#Camera Driver Help

To get the sensoray 2255s board to work, I had to remove all of the Sensoray Drivers.  Then I just plugged in the Sensoray board, and it was good to go.

##Removing drivers

Plug in the camera + sensoray 2255s combo to the computer.  
Go to 'Device Manager'.  Go to sound, video and game controllers.

Double click on the sensoray camera, and delete all drivers.

Now go to the sensorray program x86 folder, and uninstall the driver.

Then uninstall any other sensoray driver(s).

##Plug it in

Plug in the sensoray 2255s.  Let it install.  Try it out.

If it doesn't work, try going online and installing the driver from
sensoray.com.  Just google sensoray 2255s driver and you should find a
downloads page for that driver.
